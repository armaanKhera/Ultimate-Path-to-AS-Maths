# Finding the Midpoint of a Line

In Coordinate Geometry, the midpoint of a line segment is the point that divides the segment into two equal parts. It is located exactly halfway between the two endpoints of the line.

## Formula for Midpoint

The formula for finding the midpoint of a line with endpoints $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is as follows:

Midpoint (M) = $\left( \frac{\large {x_1 + x_2}}{\large 2}, \frac{\large {y_1 + y_2}}{\large 2} \right)$

## Steps to Find the Midpoint

To find the midpoint of a line, follow these steps:

1. Identify the coordinates of the two endpoints of the line, $A(x_1, y_1)$ and $B(x_2, y_2)$.
2. Use the midpoint formula to calculate the coordinates of the midpoint.
3. Substitute the values of $x_1$, $y_1$, $x_2$, and $y_2$ into the formula.
4. Simplify the expression to obtain the coordinates of the midpoint.

## Example

Let's consider an example to illustrate the process:

Given the endpoints $A(2, 4)$ and $B(6, 8)$, we can find the midpoint of the line segment AB as follows:

$\ = \left( \frac{\large {2 + 6}}{\large 2}, \frac{\large {4 + 8}}{\large 2}\right ) \ $

$\ = \left( \frac{\large {8}}{\large 2}, \frac{\large {12}}{\large 2} \right) \$

$\ = \left( 4, 6 \right)$

Therefore, the midpoint of the line segment AB is M(4, 6).
